### New front-end
![](SreenShot/00.png)

The weather isn't working because I commented it out(the api key has a limited calls). I haven't finished the search neither(the one next to links). I didn't change anything in the back-end, the login and create account in the front-end. So everything should still works as before.
#### Once you run it, it should take you to the main page (see the screenshot). If you want to try it from the login page, just change the " line 34:  isLoggedIn:true, -> isLoggedIn:false,".
